This case study is an analysis of the German Credit data. It contains details of 614 loan applicants with 13 attributes and the classification whether an applicant was granted loan or denied loan.

**Your role:** Using the available dataset, train a classification model to predict whether an applicant should be given loan.

**Goal:** Build a model to predict loan eligiblity with an average acuracy of more than 76%

**Specifics:** 

* Machine Learning task: Classification model 
* Target variable: Loan_Status 
* Input variables: Refer to data dictionary below
* Success Criteria: Accuracy of 76% and above
